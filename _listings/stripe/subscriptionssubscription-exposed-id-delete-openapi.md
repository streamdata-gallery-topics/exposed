  title: Stripe Delete Subscriptions Subscription Exposed
  description: Cancels a customer???s subscription. If you set the at_period_end parameter
    to true, the subscription will remain active until the end of the period, at which
    point it will be canceled and not renewed. By default, the subscription is terminated
    immediately. In either case, the customer will not be charged again for the subscription.
    Note, however, that any pending invoice items that you???ve created will still
    be charged for at the end of the period unless manually deleted. If you???ve set
    the subscription to cancel at period end, any pending prorations will also be
    left in place and collected at the end of the period, but if the subscription
    is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be removed.By default, all
    unpaid invoices for the customer will be closed upon subscription cancellation.
    We do this in order to prevent unexpected payment attempts once the customer has
    canceled a subscription. However, you can reopen the invoices manually after subscription
    cancellation to have us proceed with payment collection, or you could even re-attempt
    payment yourself on all unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel
    the subscription at all.
